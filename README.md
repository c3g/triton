# Triton

The triton project is an end user portal for data delivery, where clients can download the dataset files
associated with their projects. It acts as an extension to the Hercules project.

This is a new version of the Triton project that integrates with Freezeman. The original project is stored
on bitbucket and was designed to connect to the Clarity database. [Triton](https://bitbucket.org/genap/triton/src/master/)
